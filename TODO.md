- Maybe change alphagrams to charlists - would make 'abc' in tests nice and maybe integers are more efficient to pass
- Queue - separate manager and worker modules
- Allow configuring number of workers in queue via env variables
- Mo documentation
- Doctests?
- PROPERTY TESTS!?!?!
- crazy idea: sigil for alphagrams, which ensures sorted charlist
